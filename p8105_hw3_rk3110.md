### Loading libraries and data

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(ggridges)
library(viridis)

knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.width = 6,
  fig.asp = .6,
  out.width = "90%"
)

theme_set(theme_minimal() + theme(legend.position = "bottom"))

options(
  ggplot2.continuous.colour = "viridis",
  ggplot2.continuous.fill = "viridis"
)

scale_colour_discrete = scale_colour_viridis_d
scale_fill_discrete = scale_fill_viridis_d

library(p8105.datasets)
```

# Problem 1

``` r
data("instacart")
```

-   How many aisles are there. and which aisles are the most items
    ordered from?

``` r
instacart %>% 
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  summarize(n_obs = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n_obs))
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 x 2
    ##    aisle                          n_obs
    ##    <chr>                          <int>
    ##  1 fresh vegetables              150609
    ##  2 fresh fruits                  150473
    ##  3 packaged vegetables fruits     78493
    ##  4 yogurt                         55240
    ##  5 packaged cheese                41699
    ##  6 water seltzer sparkling water  36617
    ##  7 milk                           32644
    ##  8 chips pretzels                 31269
    ##  9 soy lactosefree                26240
    ## 10 bread                          23635
    ## # ... with 124 more rows

There are 134 aisles.The top 3 aisles ordered from are fresh vegetables,
fresh fruits, and packaged vegetables.

-   Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle,
    limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered. Arrange
    aisles sensibly, and organize your plot so others can read it.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  summarize(n_obs = n()) %>% 
  filter(n_obs > 10000) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(aisle, -n_obs), y = n_obs)) +
  geom_col() + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) +
  labs(
    x = "Aisle",
    y = "Number of items ordered"
  )
```

-   Make a table showing the three most popular items in each of the
    aisles “baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged
    vegetables fruits”. Include the number of times each item is ordered
    in your table.

Baking ingredients aisle id = 17 dog food care aisle id = 40 packaged
vegetables fruits aisle id = 123

``` r
instacart %>% 
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>%
  group_by(aisle) %>%
  summarize(
    product_max = max(product_name),
    n_obs = n()
  ) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

| aisle                      | product\_max                    | n\_obs |
|:---------------------------|:--------------------------------|-------:|
| baking ingredients         | Zero Calorie Sweetener          |  13088 |
| dog food care              | Zero Grain Turkey Dog Food      |   1612 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Zucchini Squash, Baby Courgette |  78493 |

This is not what I want. How do I get top 3 per group????

-   Make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady
    Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week;
    format this table for human readers (i.e. produce a 2 x 7 table).

``` r
instacart %>% 
  filter(product_name == "Pink Lady Apples" | product_name == "Coffee Ice Cream") %>% 
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>% 
  mutate(mean_hod = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>% 
  select(product_name, order_dow, mean_hod) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = "order_dow",
    values_from = "mean_hod"
  )
```

    ## Warning: Values are not uniquely identified; output will contain list-cols.
    ## * Use `values_fn = list` to suppress this warning.
    ## * Use `values_fn = length` to identify where the duplicates arise
    ## * Use `values_fn = {summary_fun}` to summarise duplicates

    ## # A tibble: 2 x 8
    ## # Groups:   product_name [2]
    ##   product_name     `3`        `2`        `1`        `6`        `4`   `0`   `5`  
    ##   <chr>            <list>     <list>     <list>     <list>     <lis> <lis> <lis>
    ## 1 Pink Lady Apples <dbl [32]> <dbl [47]> <dbl [50]> <dbl [16]> <dbl~ <dbl~ <dbl~
    ## 2 Coffee Ice Cream <dbl [22]> <dbl [21]> <dbl [19]> <dbl [36]> <dbl~ <dbl~ <dbl~

This doesn’t work at all. I’ll come back to it.

# Problem 2

``` r
data("brfss_smart2010")
```

First, some data cleaning: levels are Poor, Fair, Good, Very Good,
Excellent

``` r
brfss = 
brfss_smart2010 %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(topic == "Overall Health",
         response %in% c("Poor", "Fair", "Good", "Very Good", "Excellent")) %>% 
  mutate(response = factor(response, c("Poor", "Fair", "Good", "Very Good", "Excellent")))
```

-   In 2002, which states were observed at 7 or more locations? What
    about in 2010?

-   Construct a dataset that is limited to Excellent responses, and
    contains, year, state, and a variable that averages the data\_value
    across locations within a state. Make a “spaghetti” plot of this
    average value over time within a state (that is, make a plot showing
    a line for each state across years – the geom\_line geometry and
    group aesthetic will help).

``` r
brfss %>% 
  select(year, locationabbr, response, data_value, geo_location) %>% 
  filter(response == "Excellent") %>% 
  group_by(locationabbr, year) %>% 
  mutate(data_avg = mean(data_value)) %>% 
  select(year, locationabbr, data_avg) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = data_avg, color = locationabbr)) +
  geom_line()
```

    ## Warning: Removed 65 row(s) containing missing values (geom_path).

-   Make a two-panel plot showing, for the years 2006, and 2010,
    distribution of data\_value for responses (“Poor” to “Excellent”)
    among locations in NY State.

``` r
brfss %>% 
  filter(locationabbr == "NY", year %in% c("2006", "2007"))
```

    ## # A tibble: 52 x 23
    ##     year locationabbr locationdesc  class  topic  question  response sample_size
